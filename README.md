# pycaret-walkthrough-demo
In this Jupyter Notebook I walk you through the incredible new Python module PyCaret, which enables you to do pre-processing, model creation &amp; model improvements with single lines of code!

It's a great tool in particular for doing some quick & dirty data wrangling and modelling, enabling you to quickly show stakeholders the feasibility of an application idea you might have.
